I followed this video by Ermanno Ferrari when I was customizing OpenBox. So if you are stuck, these videos may help you: 
1. ["[9] | OpenBox: Getting Started"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRKtkmQ4yGI)

2. ["[9a] | OpenBox: Customization Tools"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly0X-oMH2fk)


You will have to tweek some stuff in the settings of XFCE4 Terminal as I don't know if the dotfile of that will work or not as XFCE is a Desktop Environment.


You can also get the wallpapers from [this repository.](https://github.com/heytuilip/wallpapers)
